      <h2>Simplify quotes. Scale your sales.</h2>
      <p>EDT Selector automates repetitive product quoting — so your sales team can focus on what really matters.
        We help you publish the products you want to quote more efficiently on your website, app, or any other digital channel you own, 
        allowing your customers to select and configure them on their own and thereby generate their own quotes.
        You decide whether to review the compiled quotes before they are sent to the customer or not.
        Of course, you can also allow your customers to place orders directly for products if you wish. </p>

      <h3>What is the EDT Selector?</h3>
      <p>Our selector is a simple yet powerful solution for publishing selected products with a quote/order function on your website.
You have full control over what you want to publish — typically standard products and spare parts that require little or no configuration. This saves time on simple, often recurring quotations done manually today and allows you to focus on requests that need more advanced configuration and design.
In the basic version of EDT Selector, you upload an Excel list of products. If you prefer integration with your business or sales support system, we’ll of course handle that as well.
Using a straightforward tool, you define how your products should appear on your website and what should happen when a customer requests a quote or places an order.
EDT Selector is a fantastic tool for digitizing your recurring quotes without switching to e-commerce or changing the way you work.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>EDT Selector works with your existing processes — it just gets faster.</li>
        <li>Your customers get faster responses, driving increased sales and satisfaction</li>
        <li>Your sales team can focus on the more complex quotations which are more challenging, less repetitive and more fun!</li>
        <li>You automatically spread expertise in your sales team — not just the veterans handle the complex quotes
        </li>
